# UL Assignment

This Assignment contains two console projects and a test project

### 1. FactorialConsole

This allows a user to enter a number, and then calculate the factorial 
of that number and print it on screen. 


### 2. FizzBuzzConsole

This prints the numbers from 1 to 100, with each on a new line. 
For multiples of 3, instead of printing the number, print “Fizz”; for multiples of five, 
print “Buzz”; for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz”.


### 3. Assignment.Tests

This project contains tests for both FizzBuzzConsole and FactorialConsole
